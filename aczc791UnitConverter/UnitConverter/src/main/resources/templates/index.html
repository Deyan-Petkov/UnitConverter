        <p>Everyone asked this question at least once when struggling with some units conversion task. Why isn't there
            one measurement system that everyone uses? Alas, the World is not perfect and there are lots of measures and
            units that make people mad in all parts of the Globe.</p>

        <p>
            The earliest recorded systems of weights and measures originate in the 3rd or 4th millennium BC. Even the
            very earliest civilizations needed measurement for purposes of agriculture, construction, and trade. Early
            standard units might only have applied to a single community or small region, with every area developing its
            own standards for lengths, areas, volumes and masses. Often such systems were closely tied to one field of
            use, so that volume measures used, for example, for dry <a href="information.html#grainInf"> grains </a>were
            unrelated to those for liquids, with neither bearing any particular relationship to units of length used for
            measuring cloth or land.
        </p>

        <p>
            With development of manufacturing technologies, and the growing importance of trade between communities and
            ultimately across the Earth, standardized weights and measures became critical. Starting in the 18th
            century, modernized, simplified and uniform systems of weights and measures were developed, with the
            fundamental units defined by ever more precise methods in the science of metrology.

        <p>
            Our measurement converter was especially designed to make your units conversion job a whole lot easier. Here
            you'll find instant conversions for some of the most common units and measurements.
        </p>

        <p>
            Try making your conversions and feel the difference. And when you're done, don't forget to save your
            favorite measurements so when you ever have a units conversion task again, you'll know where to go.
